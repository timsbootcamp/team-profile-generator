It solved the problem of generating a structure of a Team.


> What did I learn?

I learnt about ES6, Jest for TDD, Classes and Object Oriented Programming.


> What makes my project stand out? 

It stands out as I have successfully completed the exercise, used good programming practice in terms of writing clean code. I have used appropriate constants and variables that are understandable. There are comments throughout the code so it can be understood by any developer.  

I have pushed myself continually ensuring my work is of the highest quality. The code is readable and maintainable.
